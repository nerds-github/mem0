# Mem0 API Overview

Mem0 provides a powerful set of APIs that allow you to integrate advanced memory management capabilities into your applications. Our APIs are designed to be intuitive, efficient, and scalable, enabling you to create, retrieve, update, and delete memories across various entities such as users, agents, apps, and runs.

## Key Features

- **Memory Management**: Add, retrieve, update, and delete memories with ease.
- **Entity-based Operations**: Perform operations on memories associated with specific users, agents, apps, or runs.
- **Advanced Search**: Utilize our search API to find relevant memories based on various criteria.
- **History Tracking**: Access the history of memory interactions for comprehensive analysis.
- **User Management**: Manage user entities and their associated memories.

## API Structure

Our API is organized into several main categories:

1. **Memory APIs**: Core operations for managing individual memories and collections.
2. **Entities APIs**: Manage different entity types (users, agents, etc.) and their associated memories.
3. **Search API**: Advanced search functionality to retrieve relevant memories.
4. **History API**: Track and retrieve the history of memory interactions.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using HTTP Basic Auth. Ensure you include your API key in the Authorization header of each request.

## Organizations and projects (optional)

For users who belong to multiple organizations or are working on multiple projects, you can specify the organization and project for an API request. This is done by initializing the Mem0 client with the appropriate parameters. Usage from these API requests will be attributed to the specified organization and project.

Example with the mem0 Python package:

```python
from mem0 import MemoryClient

# Recommended: Using organization and project IDs
client = MemoryClient(
    org_id='YOUR_ORG_ID',
    project_id='YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
)
```
> **Note**: The use of `organization` and `project` parameters is deprecated and will be removed in version `0.1.40`. Please use `org_id` and `project_id` instead.


Example with the mem0 Node.js package:

```javascript
import { MemoryClient } from "mem0ai";

// Recommended: Using organization and project IDs
const client = new MemoryClient({
    organizationId: "YOUR_ORG_ID",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
});
```

## Getting Started

To begin using the Mem0 API, you'll need to:

1. Sign up for a [Mem0 account](https://app.mem0.ai) and obtain your API key.
2. Familiarize yourself with the API endpoints and their functionalities.
3. Make your first API call to add or retrieve a memory.

Explore the detailed documentation for each API endpoint to learn more about request/response formats, parameters, and example usage.
